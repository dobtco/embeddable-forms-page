Embeddable Forms Page
====

Live demo: http://dobtco.github.io/embeddable-forms-page/

This is a proof-of-concept that demonstrates how to use [Screendoor's](https://screendoor.dobt.co) public API and [formrenderer-base](https://github.com/dobtco/formrenderer-base) in order to embed multiple Screendoor forms onto your website, all with minimal coding required.

## Current limitations

- Projects that require signature / fees will need to be filled out on Screendoor
